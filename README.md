## Introduction

This project is based off my previous one: [Template for CMake based C Projects](https://github.com/hungrybluedev/CMake-Basic-C-Template)

The goal of this experiment/template is to make an accessible starting point for creating cross-platform builds for CMake-based C projects. Additionally, it uploads the binaries built and adds them to the release.

I faced a few roadblocks and along the way and some issues remained unresolved. One of them was that you cannot upload several assets to the same release. So I create several releases from different operating systems and mark them as drafts. Then I download the separate binaries and

## Commands

To generate the build files:

```bash
/path/to/src $ cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -S . -B build
```

This generates _Unix Makefiles_ for the src (`.`) in the build directory (`build`).

- Type `cmake --help` for a list of available generators.
- (Suggestion) Change `-B build` to `-B release` for release.
- Leave out the `-G` option to use the default generator.

To start the build:

```bash
/path/to/src $ cmake --build build
```

Note that we do not need to move into the `build` folder.

To build a release version:

```bash
/path/to/src $ cmake --build release --config Release
```

Check [this link](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.html) for more information of the different configurations available.

## The `.github/workflows/release.yml` File

This is the main highlight for this repository. The `main.yml` file is the same as the one used in [Template for CMake based C Projects](https://github.com/hungrybluedev/CMake-Basic-C-Template).

A simplified explanation of the algorithm is as follows:

1. Use a matrix of OSes so that the same "script" can be run on all the target platforms.
2. Checkout the code from the repository.
3. Download (from the internet, or cache) and install CMake.
4. Run CMake using the `Release` configuration.
5. Create a Github release.
6. Upload the binary from that particular OS to the newly created release.

There is a conditional statement to account for the `.exe` extension for the Windows build. Also, the build triggers only on tags that are prefixed with `v` (for example, strings like `v2`, `v0.3`, `v1.0.23` will all match). This can be changed easily.

## Features

1. A minimal yet complete project template for cross platform CLI application builds.
2. Pragmatic directory structure is suggested with the existing code.
3. Readable CMake configuration that can be customised easily.
4. Inclusion of [Âµnit](https://nemequ.github.io/munit/) as the recommended unit-testing framework. It can be changed easily; just read the CMake and use the given directory structture to add your own library of choice.
5. Integration with Github Actions. It ensures cross-platform builds and ensures that all unit-tests are successful (unless skipped).
6. Inclusion of suggested badges for the project's README.
7. Creation of draft releases with multi-platform release builds available for download. (Requires some manual intervention.)

## Problems

The release action config does not create a single release. It creates 3 different draft releases. The maintainer can download these assets, rename them, sign them if needed, then re-upload to a final non-draft release, complete with all instructions, changelog, hash values, etc.

I realise that this is a bit of an inconvenience but it is still amazing that you can build release assets for all three major OSes that is, Windows, Linux, and MacOS without having to depend on local installations of these.

If you know how to create only one release and upload all three release assets to that single release, [let me know](https://hungrybluedev.in/contact/) or create an "issue - pull request" pair!

## Acknowledgement

Big thanks to lukka for the [get-cmake](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/get-cmake) and [run-cmake](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-cmake) Github actions!

There was a slight issue in get-cmake which was causing the MacOS builds to fail. So I [reported it](https://github.com/lukka/get-cmake/issues/14) and Lukka responded, worked on it and it was fixed within a day!
